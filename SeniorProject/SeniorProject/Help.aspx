    <p>
        Assuming since you are here at the help page, you are having problems with RED. 
        Let&#39;s explain how a few things work...</p>
    <p>
        To actually go anywhere in the system, you must use the menu located at the top 
        of each page. Don&#39;t worry, this menu is on every page, so you shouldn&#39;t get 
        lost. The menu items are prety self explanitory, so feel free to look around ang 
        get the feel for these pages. RED was designed to be easy to use.</p>
    <p>
        If you are having problems using RED or RED is having problems, please contact 
        Seth Thoenen by either visiting the ResNet offices, calling 417-836-5100, or 
        send him an <a href="mailto:smt10@live.missouristate.edu">e-mail</a>.</p>
